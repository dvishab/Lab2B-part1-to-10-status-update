In part 7, I spent a lot of time in figuring out the correct instructions to be sent to use PIO as IO. I reffered to few online sources and wrote a .pio file and was finally able to get it working. 

In part 8, I faced issues in implementing the proximity sensing. The proximity reading does not get updated based on the sensing. I reffered to the APDS datasheet and followed the flow given for enabling the proximity step by step.
